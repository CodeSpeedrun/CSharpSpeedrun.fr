/* What is Single Responsibility Principle?
This principle recomments every software modules such as class, structures, methods among others should accomplish only one job. Hence only one reason to change. The modules should not multitask like a Swiss knife, just because we can put every line of code in a single class, doesnâ€™t mean we should.
