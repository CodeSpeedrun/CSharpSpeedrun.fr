/*What is StringBuilder?
The string data type is designed to be immutable. In other words, once it is created, it cannot be modified. When a string variable is assigned a new value, the compiler creates a new string object in memory. As you can guess, repeatedly assigning new values to variables hinders performance.

The StringBuilder was introduced to solve this issue. It doesnâ€™t create a new string objects, instead, it constantly expands memory to house the newly modified string.
