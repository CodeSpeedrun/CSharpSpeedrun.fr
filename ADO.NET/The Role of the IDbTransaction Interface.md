The Role of the IDbTransaction Interface

The overloaded BeginTransaction() method defined by IDbConnection provides access to the providerâ€™s
transaction object. You can use the members defined by IDbTransaction to interact programmatically with a
transactional session and the underlying data store.
public interface IDbTransaction : IDisposable
{
IDbConnection Connection { get; }
IsolationLevel IsolationLevel { get; }
void Commit();
void Rollback();
void Dispose();
}
