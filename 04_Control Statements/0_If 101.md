# C# Pattern Matching Examples

## Introduction
Pattern matching is a powerful feature in C# that allows for more concise and expressive code when dealing with complex data structures. It enables you to match patterns in data types, making your code more readable and maintainable.

## Basic Pattern Matching
```csharp
object item1 = 123;
object item2 = "Hello";

if (item1 is string stringValue)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{stringValue} is a string");
}
```
In this example, we use the `is` keyword to check if `item1` is of type `string`. If it is, the value is assigned to the variable `stringValue` and then printed.

## Type Patterns
```csharp
object item1 = 123;
Type itemType = typeof(string);
char character = 'f';

if (itemType is Type)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{itemType} is a Type");
}
```
Here, we utilize the `is` keyword to check if `itemType` is of type `Type`, which it is. Thus, we print that `itemType` is indeed a type.

## Relational, Conjunctive, and Disjunctive Patterns
```csharp
if (character is >= 'a' and <= 'z' or >= 'A' and <= 'Z')
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{character} is a character");
};
```
This snippet demonstrates relational, conjunctive, and disjunctive patterns. It checks if `character` is within the range of lowercase or uppercase letters and prints accordingly.

## Parenthesized Patterns
```csharp
if (character is (>= 'a' and <= 'z') or (>= 'A' and <= 'Z') or '.' or ',')
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{character} is a character or separator");
};
```
Here, we use parenthesized patterns to group conditions. It checks if `character` is a letter or specific separators like '.' or ','.

## Negative Patterns
```csharp
if (item1 is not string)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{item1} is not a string");
}

if (item1 is not null)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{item1} is not null");
}
```
These snippets showcase negative patterns. The first one checks if `item1` is not a string, while the second one checks if `item1` is not null.

## Ternary Conditional Operator
```csharp
condition ? first_expression : second_expression;
```
The ternary conditional operator is a concise way to express conditional statements. If `condition` is true, `first_expression` is evaluated; otherwise, `second_expression` is evaluated.

## Example Usage of Ternary Operator
```csharp
string data = "example";
(data.Length > 0) ? Console.WriteLine("String is greater than 0 characters") : Console.WriteLine("String is not greater than 0 characters");
```
This code checks if the length of the string `data` is greater than 0. If true, it prints a message indicating that the string has characters; otherwise, it prints a message indicating the absence of characters.

```
