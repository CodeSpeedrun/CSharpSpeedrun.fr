Entity Framework Core

goal of EF is to allow you to interact with data from relational databases using an object
model that maps directly to the business objects (or domain objects) in your application. For example,
rather than treating a batch of data as a collection of rows and columns, you can operate on a collection of
strongly typed objects termed entities.
