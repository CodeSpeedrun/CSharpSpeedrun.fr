# Understanding C# Structures vs Classes

In C#, structures and classes are fundamental constructs for organizing and representing data. While both share similarities, they have distinct characteristics and use cases. Let's delve into the differences and nuances between structures and classes in C#.

## Structures

### Definition and Characteristics
Structures in C# are lightweight data types used to represent small, simple objects. They are value types, meaning they are copied when passed as arguments or assigned to another variable. Unlike classes, structures are implicitly sealed, which means they cannot be inherited or serve as base classes.

### Use Cases
Structures are ideal for modeling atomic data types or small aggregates of related data. They are commonly employed for representing entities such as points, rectangles, and other simple data structures.

### Code Example
```csharp
public struct Point
{
    public int X;
    public int Y;
}
```
The `Point` structure represents a Cartesian coordinate with integer components `X` and `Y`.

## Classes

### Definition and Characteristics
Classes are reference types in C#, meaning they are allocated on the heap and accessed via references. They support inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Unlike structures, classes are explicitly declared as either sealed or inheritable.

### Use Cases
Classes are suitable for modeling complex objects with behaviors and state. They are extensively used for creating reusable components, defining business logic, and implementing various software patterns such as inheritance, abstraction, and composition.

### Code Example
```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }

    public void DisplayInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Name: {Name}, Age: {Age}");
    }
}
```
The `Person` class encapsulates attributes such as `Name` and `Age`, along with a method `DisplayInfo()` to present the person's information.

## Key Differences

1. **Inheritance**: Classes support inheritance, allowing for the creation of class hierarchies and the implementation of the "is-a" relationship, whereas structures cannot be inherited.
2. **Memory Allocation**: Structures are allocated on the stack, leading to efficient memory usage for small, short-lived objects, while classes are allocated on the heap, suitable for larger, long-lived objects.
3. **Mutability**: Fields in structures are mutable by default, whereas class fields can be made immutable through proper encapsulation and access modifiers.
4. **Performance**: Due to their stack allocation and value semantics, structures can offer better performance in certain scenarios, especially when dealing with small data types and frequent copying.

## Conclusion

Understanding the differences between structures and classes is crucial for designing efficient and maintainable C# code. By leveraging structures for simple data types and classes for complex objects, developers can create robust and scalable applications.
