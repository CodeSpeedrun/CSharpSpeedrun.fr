```csharp
int[] originalNumbers = {30, 40, 1, 2, 3};
// LINQ query to filter numbers less than 10 from the originalNumbers array
var filteredSubset =    from num in originalNumbers
                        where num < 10
                        select num;
Console.Write("Values in filtered subset: ");
// Printing the filtered numbers
foreach (var num in filteredSubset)
{
    Console.Write("{0} ", num);

# LINQ (Language Integrated Query) in C#

## Introduction
LINQ is a powerful feature in C# that allows developers to query data from various data sources using a SQL-like syntax directly within the C# language. It provides a uniform way of querying data from collections, databases, XML documents, and more.

## LINQ Query
In the provided code snippet, a LINQ query is used to filter numbers less than 10 from an array called `originalNumbers`. This is done using the `where` clause in the LINQ query, which acts as a filter condition. 

## Syntax Breakdown
- `from num in originalNumbers`: This part of the LINQ query sets up a range variable `num` to iterate over the elements in the `originalNumbers` array.
- `where num < 10`: This is the filter condition that selects only those elements from the `originalNumbers` array which are less than 10.
- `select num`: This part of the query specifies the elements that should be included in the result set.

## Execution
- The LINQ query selects the numbers less than 10 from the `originalNumbers` array.
- The selected numbers are then printed to the console.

## Output
The output of this code will be:
```
Values in filtered subset: 1 2 3 
```

## Further Learning
- **LINQ Operators**: Learn about various LINQ operators such as `where`, `select`, `group by`, `order by`, etc.
- **Query Expressions vs. Method Syntax**: Understand the difference between query expressions (as shown in this example) and method syntax for writing LINQ queries.
- **LINQ to Objects, SQL, XML**: Explore how LINQ can be used to query different data sources like collections, databases, and XML documents.
- **Performance Considerations**: Learn about the performance implications of using LINQ and how to optimize LINQ queries for better performance.
