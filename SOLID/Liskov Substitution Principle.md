/* What is Liskov Substitution Principle?
It is recommended that any derived class should be interchangeble 
with the parent class and the output should be identical. 
In other words, a derived class must be substitutable for 
its parent class. Letâ€™s say a mother is an Engineer 
while her son is a teacher, although they are related, 
the son cannot replace the Engineer at work.
