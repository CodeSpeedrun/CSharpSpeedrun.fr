# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Introduction

In this lecture, we'll delve into the foundational concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), often referred to as the pillars of OOP: **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Abstraction** and **Polymorphism**. These concepts are crucial for understanding how to design and structure code in an object-oriented manner.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, typically a class. It allows us to hide the internal implementation details of an object and provides a way to ensure data integrity. 

### Example:

```csharp
class Car
{
    // The 'state' of the Car.
    public string Name; // Encapsulation allows access to this field through methods.
    private int _speed; // Encapsulation hides this field from external access.

    // Method to set the speed of the car.
    public void SetSpeed(int speed)
    {
        _speed = speed;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Name` field is public, allowing access to it from outside the class, while the `_speed` field is private, ensuring it can only be modified through the `SetSpeed` method.

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism by which a new class can inherit properties and behavior from an existing class, promoting code reuse and establishing a hierarchy of classes.

### Example:

```csharp
class Vehicle
{
    public string Make;
    public string Model;
}

class Car : Vehicle // Car inherits from Vehicle
{
    public int Year;
}
```

Here, the `Car` class inherits the `Make` and `Model` properties from the `Vehicle` class.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type. It enables flexibility and extensibility in code by allowing methods to be overridden in derived classes.

### Example:

```csharp
class Animal
{
    public virtual void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks.");
    }
}

class Cat : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Cat meows.");
    }
}
```

In this example, both `Dog` and `Cat` classes inherit from the `Animal` class and override the `MakeSound` method to provide specific behavior.

## Best Practices

- **Namespace Usage**: While not strictly required in these examples, it's good practice to use namespaces to organize your code and avoid naming conflicts.

- **Access Modifiers**: Field data of a class should seldom be defined as public; instead, prefer encapsulation by using private or internal access modifiers.

- **Naming Conventions**: Start private (or internal) class-level variable names with an underscore to differentiate them from public members.

By understanding and applying these OOP concepts, you can write more organized, maintainable, and extensible code in C#.
