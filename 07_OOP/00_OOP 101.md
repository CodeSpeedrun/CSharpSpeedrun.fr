often called the pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP):
• Encapsulation: How does this language hide an object’s internal implementation
details and preserve data integrity?
• Inheritance: How does this language promote code reuse?
• Polymorphism: How does this language let you treat related objects in a similar way?

one of the most fundamental programming constructs is the class
type.
of field data (often called member variables

    Defining a namespace is strictly required for these examples. However, it is a good practice to get
into the habit of using namespaces for all of your code.

class Car
{
// The 'state' of the Car.
public string petName;
public int currSpeed;
}

Field data of a class should seldom (if ever) be defined as public.

Car myCar;
myCar = new Car();
myCar.petName = "Fred";

start private (or internal) class-level variable names with an
underscore (e.g., _driverName) so IntelliSense shows all of your variables at the top of the list.
