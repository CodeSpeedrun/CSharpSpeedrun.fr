```csharp
// Create an instance of the Employee class.
Employee employee = new Employee();

// Error! Cannot directly access private members
// from an object!
employee._employeeName = "Anna";

// Define a class called Employee
class Employee
{
    // Field data. This field is private, meaning it can only be accessed
    // within the class itself.
    private string _employeeName;
    
    // Accessor method (also known as a "getter").
    // This method allows external code to retrieve the value of the private field _employeeName.
    public string GetName() => _employeeName;
    
    // Mutator method (also known as a "setter").
    // This method allows external code to modify the value of the private field _employeeName,
    // but first, it performs a check on the incoming value before assignment.
    public void SetName(string name)
    {
        // Do a check on incoming value before making assignment.
        if (name.Length > 13)
        {
            // If the length of the name exceeds 13 characters, display an error message.
            Console.WriteLine("Error! Name length exceeds 13 characters!");
        }
        else
        {
            // Otherwise, assign the name to the _employeeName field.
            _employeeName = name;
        }
    }
}
```

In the provided code:

- An `Employee` class is defined with a private field `_employeeName`. The use of private access modifier ensures that this field is only accessible within the `Employee` class itself.
- `GetName()` is an accessor method, also known as a "getter," which allows external code to retrieve the value of `_employeeName`.
- `SetName(string name)` is a mutator method, also known as a "setter," which allows external code to modify the value of `_employeeName`. However, before assigning a new value, it performs a check to ensure that the length of the name does not exceed 15 characters. If it does, an error message is displayed; otherwise, the new name is assigned to the `_employeeName` field.

These accessors and mutators are commonly used to enforce encapsulation in object-oriented programming. They provide controlled access to the private members of a class, allowing for validation and data integrity checks before modification or retrieval. This ensures that the internal state of an object remains consistent and valid throughout its lifetime.
