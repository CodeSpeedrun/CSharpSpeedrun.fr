# Constructor Chaining in C#

Constructor chaining is a design pattern used when a class has multiple constructors. It allows constructors to call other constructors within the same class, simplifying code and reducing redundancy. In C#, constructor chaining is achieved using the `this` keyword.

## Example Implementation

```csharp
class Motorcycle
{
    public int RiderIntensity;
    public string RiderName;

    // Default constructor
    public Motorcycle()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("In default constructor");
    }

    // Constructor chaining - calls the constructor with an integer parameter
    public Motorcycle(int intensity) : this(intensity, "")
    {
        Console.WriteLine("In constructor taking an integer");
    }

    // Constructor chaining - calls the constructor with a string parameter
    public Motorcycle(string name) : this(0, name)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("In constructor taking a string");
    }

    // Master constructor that does the real work
    public Motorcycle(int intensity, string name)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("In master constructor");
        if (intensity > 10)
        {
            intensity = 10; // Limit intensity to a maximum of 10
        }
        RiderIntensity = intensity;
        RiderName = name;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

### Constructor Overloading
- Constructor overloading allows a class to have multiple constructors with different parameter lists.
- In the `Motorcycle` class, there are four constructors, each with different parameter lists.

### Constructor Chaining
- Constructor chaining is achieved by using the `this` keyword followed by the appropriate constructor call.
- In the `Motorcycle` class, the constructors with fewer parameters call constructors with more parameters using `this`.

### Default Constructor
- The default constructor initializes a `Motorcycle` object with default values.
- It doesn't take any parameters.

### Constructors with Parameters
- Constructors with parameters provide flexibility in creating `Motorcycle` objects with specified attributes.
- They handle cases where the intensity level or rider name is provided during object creation.

### Master Constructor
- The master constructor performs the main initialization logic.
- It ensures that the intensity level is never greater than 10 by limiting it if necessary.
- It sets the intensity and name of the rider.

## Usage
```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Creating Motorcycle objects using different constructors
        Motorcycle bike1 = new Motorcycle();
        Motorcycle bike2 = new Motorcycle(8);
        Motorcycle bike3 = new Motorcycle("John");
        Motorcycle bike4 = new Motorcycle(15, "Jane");

        // Output:
        // In default constructor
        // In master constructor
        // In constructor taking an integer
        // In master constructor
        // In constructor taking a string
        // In master constructor
        // In master constructor
    }
}
```

In this example, we demonstrate creating `Motorcycle` objects using different constructors, showcasing constructor chaining and the execution flow of constructors.
