# Introduction to Inheritance in C#

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages like C#. It allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, known as the base class or superclass. In C#, every type ultimately derives from a base class named `System.Object`, which provides a set of common members for every type in the framework.

## The `Object` Class

The `Object` class in C# is the root of all classes in the .NET Framework Class Library. It defines a set of common members that are inherited by all types.

```csharp
public class BaseClass
{
    // Virtual members.
    public virtual bool AreEqual(object obj);
    protected virtual void FinalizeProcess();
    public virtual int GenerateHashCode();
    public virtual string ConvertToString();
    // Instance-level, nonvirtual members.
    public Type RetrieveType();
    protected object CloneMemberwise();
    // Static members.
    public static bool CheckEquality(object objA, object objB);
    public static bool CheckReferenceEquality(object objA, object objB);
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `Object` class contains both virtual and nonvirtual members.
- Virtual members can be overridden in derived classes to provide custom implementations.
- Nonvirtual members are not intended for overriding.
- Static members belong to the class itself rather than instances of the class.

## Example Usage

```csharp
public class CustomClass : BaseClass
{
    // Override virtual method for custom behavior.
    public override bool AreEqual(object obj)
    {
        // Custom implementation for equality comparison.
        return base.AreEqual(obj);
    }
    
    // Implement nonvirtual method.
    public Type RetrieveType()
    {
        // Return the type of the current instance.
        return base.RetrieveType();
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- In the `CustomClass`, the `AreEqual` method is overridden to provide custom equality comparison logic.
- The `RetrieveType` method is implemented without overriding, as it is a nonvirtual method from the base class.

## Inheritance Relationships

```csharp
// Example of inheritance in C#.
class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    // Additional members and methods can be defined here.
}
```

### Explanation:
- `DerivedClass` inherits from `BaseClass`, meaning it inherits all members and methods defined in `BaseClass`.
- Additional members and methods specific to `DerivedClass` can be added.

## Conclusion

Understanding inheritance is crucial for designing flexible and maintainable object-oriented systems in C#. By leveraging inheritance, you can create hierarchical relationships between classes, promoting code reuse and simplifying maintenance.
