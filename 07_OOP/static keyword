A C# class may define any number of static members,

the member in question must be invoked directly from the class level, rather than from an object
reference variable.

Static data is allocated once and shared among all instances of the class

all saving accounts should have the same interest rate. Because static data
is shared by all objects of the same category, if you were to change it in any way, all objects will “see” the
new value the next time they access the static data,

// A static constructor!
static SavingsAccount()
{
Console.WriteLine("In static ctor!");
currInterestRate = 0.04;
}

// This is just fine.
TimeUtilClass.PrintDate();
TimeUtilClass.PrintTime();
// Compiler error! Can't create instance of static classes!
TimeUtilClass u = new TimeUtilClass ();
