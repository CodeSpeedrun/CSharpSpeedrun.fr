### Guard Clauses with Local Functions

Guard clauses are conditions placed at the beginning of a method to ensure that the method can proceed safely. In C#, local functions allow you to define private functions within other functions, which can be useful for encapsulating logic within a method.

```csharp
public IEnumerator GetCarEnumerator()
{
    // Guard clause to check if carArray is null or empty
    if (carArray == null || carArray.Length == 0)
    {
        throw new Exception("Car array is empty");
    }

    // Local function that yields cars from carArray
    IEnumerator ActualCarEnumerator()
    {
        foreach (var car in carArray)
        {
            yield return car;
        }
    }

    // Exception is thrown immediately
    throw new Exception("Exception thrown immediately");
    
    // Return the local function for iteration
    return ActualCarEnumerator();
}
```

#### Explanation:
- The `GetCarEnumerator` method returns an `IEnumerator` which can be used to iterate over a collection of cars.
- The guard clause at the beginning ensures that the method doesn't proceed if the `carArray` is null or empty.
- A local function named `ActualCarEnumerator` is defined inside `GetCarEnumerator`, responsible for yielding cars from `carArray`.
- An exception is thrown immediately after the guard clause if the `carArray` is empty.
- Finally, the local function `ActualCarEnumerator` is returned to facilitate iteration over cars.

#### Additional Information:
- Guard clauses enhance code safety by preventing execution when preconditions are not met.
- Local functions aid in encapsulating logic within methods, improving readability and maintainability.
- Exception handling is crucial for dealing with unexpected situations, ensuring robustness in applications.

### Example Usage:

```csharp
var carCollection = new CarCollection();
try
{
    var enumerator = carCollection.GetCarEnumerator();
    while (enumerator.MoveNext())
    {
        var currentCar = enumerator.Current;
        Console.WriteLine($"Car: {currentCar}");
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Exception occurred: {ex.Message}");
}
```

In this example, we create a `CarCollection` instance and attempt to retrieve an enumerator using the `GetCarEnumerator` method. If the method encounters any issues such as an empty car array, an exception will be caught and handled gracefully. Otherwise, we iterate over the cars in the collection and perform some action with each car.
