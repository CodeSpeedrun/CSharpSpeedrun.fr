**Understanding Static Constructors and Members in C# Interfaces**

In C# 8 and later, interfaces gained the ability to have static members, offering new possibilities for code organization and initialization. Let's delve into this concept, exploring its syntax, usage, and potential applications.

**1. Interface Definition:**

Begin by defining an interface named `IShape` that serves as the foundation for various geometric shapes:

```csharp
public interface IShape
{
    double Area { get; }
    string Name { get; set; }

    // Abstract methods (implementation required in implementing classes)
    double GetPerimeter();
}
```

Here's a breakdown:

- `IShape` defines two properties:
    - `Area`: Calculated by each implementing class to reflect its specific shape.
    - `Name`: Stores a descriptive name for the shape.
- `GetPerimeter()` is an abstract method that each implementing class must provide a concrete implementation for, depending on its shape.

**2. Adding a Static Member:**

Introduce a static property named `DefaultMaterial` to `IShape`, allowing all implementing classes to share the same default material if desired:

```csharp
public interface IShape
{
    // Existing members...

    static string DefaultMaterial { get; set; }
}
```

Remember that:

- Static members belong to the interface itself, not instances of implementing classes.
- They are accessed using the interface name, as you'll see later.

**3. Initializing the Static Member:**

Utilize a static constructor (parameterless method named after the interface with `.ctor` appended) to initialize `DefaultMaterial` when the interface is first used:

```csharp
public interface IShape
{
    // Existing members...

    static string DefaultMaterial { get; set; }

    static IShape()
    {
        DefaultMaterial = "Plastic"; // Set the default material
    }
}
```

Key points:

- The static constructor executes only once, typically when the first implementing class or static member is referenced.
- It can initialize static members and perform other setup tasks that apply to all implementations.

**4. Implementing the Interface:**

Create a class named `Square` that implements `IShape`, providing concrete implementations for its abstract methods and using the `DefaultMaterial` property:

```csharp
public class Square : IShape
{
    private double sideLength;

    public Square(double sideLength)
    {
        this.sideLength = sideLength;
    }

    public double Area => sideLength * sideLength;

    public string Name { get; set; }

    public double GetPerimeter() => 4 * sideLength;

    public static void SetDefaultMaterial(string material)
    {
        IShape.DefaultMaterial = material; // Access and modify the interface's static member
    }
}
```

Explanations:

- `Square` implements `IShape`, providing concrete implementations for `Area`, `Name`, and `GetPerimeter`.
- It leverages the `DefaultMaterial` property:
    - The constructor uses the current default (`Plastic`).
    - The `SetDefaultMaterial` static method allows customizing the default material for all subsequent `Square` instances.

**5. Accessing and Modifying Static Members:**

Utilize the interface name to access and modify static members, as demonstrated in the `Main` method:

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Square square1 = new Square(5);
    square1.Name = "My Square";

    Console.WriteLine($"Square 1: Area = {square1.Area}, Name = {square1.Name}, Material = {square1.DefaultMaterial}"); // Output: Square 1: Area = 25, Name = My Square, Material = Plastic

    Square.SetDefaultMaterial("Wood"); // Modify the default material globally

    Square square2 = new Square(7);
    square2.Name = "Another Square";

    Console.WriteLine($"Square 2: Area = {square2.Area}, Name = {square2.Name}, Material = {square2.DefaultMaterial}"); // Output: Square 2: Area = 49, Name = Another Square, Material = Wood
}
```

Key takeaways:

- Static members are accessed using the interface name, not individual instances.
- Modifying a static member affects all implementing classes and future instances.
