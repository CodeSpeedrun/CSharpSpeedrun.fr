/* Task List in Visual Studio
In Visual Studio, comment tokens like TODO, HACK, NOTE and UNDONE are available to track comments. Letâ€™s say we need to develop a feature in a particular class, then we can tag that class with a comment token, and later we can easily find it with the Task List. The Task List can be activated by clicking on View > Task List.
