Assembly-Level Attributes

// List "using" statements first.
using System;
// Now list any assembly- or module-level attributes.
// Enforce CLS compliance for all public types in this
// assembly.
[assembly: CLSCompliant(true)]
If you now add a bit of code that falls outside the CLS specification (such as an exposed point of
unsigned data), you will be issued a compiler warning.
