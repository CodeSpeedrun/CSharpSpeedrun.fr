Visual Studio Object Browser (via the View ➤ Object Browser menu
item) to view the System namespace, you would see that all the members of the Console, Math, Environment,

excluding methods already overridden.

Visual Studio provides a code snippet template named Exception that
will autogenerate a new exception class that adheres to .NET best practices. To activate it, type exc in the
